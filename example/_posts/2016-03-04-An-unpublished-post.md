I'm in the process of writing this super awesome post about something very exciting but because it's still a work in progress, I'm marking this file as a draft by specifying `draft: true` in the FrontMatter. This will work for ContentItems, and not just "blog posts."

During the build process, you can use the `--use-drafts` option to build the stakx website with drafts.
