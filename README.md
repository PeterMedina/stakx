# Stakx

Stakx is a static website generator written in PHP as a popular alternative to Jekyll or Sculpin. This project is still a work in progress and has yet to see a stable release but is functional.

## Sample Usage

This project is still under heavy development and a lot of things are still changing under the hood, but building websites is functional! There are still a lot of things planned and more features to come but a sample Stakx website is provided in the `example` directory. Here's how to use Stakx to build the website.

```bash
cd example/
php ../src/stakx.php build
```
